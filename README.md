Programming Assignment (due April 19): Write a program to calculate the edit distance between two words and output both the matrix of distance calculation and an alignment that demonstrates the result. Your program should ask for input of two words, calculate the edit distance, output the matrix of calculation and an alignment that verifies the edit distance. You may use any programming language that you are most familiar. In front of your submission you should include a paragraph of comments describing how I can compile and test your program, including the required tools/environment. MATLAB is not acceptable since I do not have MATLAB in my computer.
